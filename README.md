                                                    USING AI FOR GOOD!

Using IBM Watson technology to help combat human trafficking.

This project will consist of two parts:
        1) Image recognition
        2) Natural language processing

                                                  1) Image recognition AI
Train a watson artificial intelligence to better recognise scenes of human trafficking (e.g. sweatshops, domestic servitude, agricultural work etc. ). Current  AI models give lackluster results when interpreting scenes of human tracking. Our model will be trained on images of such scenes and should give better results.

                                              2) Natural Language processing AI
Use Watson natural language processing or other viable alternatives to process and extract information from news articles regarding human tracking. This information could include such things as nationality, age, location, gender.
