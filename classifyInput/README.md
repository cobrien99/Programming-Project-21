This is a simple program that allows the user to query our Watson models with either a piece of text or an image and
recieve a classification result

To classify an image type IC and enter the path to the filename (remember to add the file extension at the end)
for example to classify and jpg image called ChildLabour thats in the same folder as the program, type "ChildLabour.jpg"
the file "testImage.jpg" is included in the folder so you can test the model on tht if you wish

To classify text type NLC and type in the text you want classified

Wait a second as the program connects to the model and dont worry about any red messages that show up first, that means its working
